# SQL Learning

A SQL refresher changelog as I pursue certifications related.

# Change/Activity Log 

**25.May.2025** - Zooming through SQL.  Finished module 1(of 6) after starting yesterday.  Will pause this for today and shift back to py.

**25.May.2025** - I haven't updated in awhile - First sick during my birthday and now again this past week, and of course we have been circulating it through the family.  Should be back on track tomorrow. Also noting that I am refreshing on SQL in conjunction with this by splitting my time between the two with a 3:1 ratio (Python as Primary). I don't suspect too much trouble with SQL. Will pursue certifications on Python and SQL this year, maybe SQL first being I'm more comfortable with that.  We'll see.
