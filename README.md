All things SQL

#Touching up on my SQL knowledge as I pursue SQL certifications.  
#This readme will act as a changelog as I progress with my learning roadmap.

25-May-2025 - Going through the Mimo course on SQL (while focusing primarily on Python) to refresh my SQL knowledge. Will eventually bite the bullet and certify on SQL this year... or at least that's the plan.
